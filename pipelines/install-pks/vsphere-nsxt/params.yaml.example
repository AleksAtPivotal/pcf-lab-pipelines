# LBR definition
# By default, all the server pools would use Layer 4 - TCP pass through
# No ssl termination or handling, uses default tcp active monitor & auto map for virtual server
# Auto Map mode uses LB interface IP and ephemeral port.
# In scenarios where both Clients and Pool Members are attached to the same Logical Router,
# SNAT (Auto Map or IP List) must be used.

# LBR Sizing guide
# LB Size | Virtual Servers | Pool Members
# small   |   10            |   30
# medium  |  100            |  300
# large   | 1000            | 3000

# No. of LBs per edge based on size of edge
# Edge Size | Small LBs| Medium LBs| Large LBs
#
# small     |    0     |   0       | 0
# medium    |    1     |   0       | 0 # Recommended for running only PAS or PKS
# large     |    4     |   1       | 1 # Recommended for running PAS + PKS
# Bare metal - not handled here

## Allow user to specify the NS Group association -> in that case, member details wont be used.
## Also, if ns group is used, specify the active monitor name. Otherwise default to the default builtin tcp monitor

## Additionally, max pool member size (max_members) need to be specified when using NSG/Dynamic membership
## The maximum size of pool members for SMALL load balancer service form factor is 30
## So, ensure the total pool members does not go over the supported config for a given lbr size
## Default max members per pool is 4, if not specified
